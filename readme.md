# Welcome to Limentum Projects!
## a site built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages.

This site is a place for me to share my projects, thoughts, and ideas. I'm a musician, software developer, and writer. I'm always working on something new, so check back often for updates!

I've made this GitHub Repo public for the purpose of sharing my work with others, even if it may not be of much use to anyone else. But I hope you get some level of enjoyment out of the website itself, or the projects I share here!
