Last night, I thought of you.

Years ago, when bodies grew.

An empty home,

a vacant Hell.

I knew you,

in the harsh realm.

"Someone else will see it for myself…" I mumbled under my breath, as I chopped up a part of green onion.

"What’d you say?" Liam said, typing away at his research paper.

"Oh sorry, just talking to myself," I assured, laughing. Even if I did say it out loud, it was a bit of a nonsensical phrase

It’s been about two hours since… whatever that was. Apparently, I was gone for an hour. On top of that, Shae called Liam claiming that I never showed at the cabin to let her inside, so he went up to do it instead. He left our stuff there, assuming we’d be heading back afterwards anyway. It didn’t feel I was gone an hour… twenty minutes tops. Besides that, I checked my phone shortly after, and both calls showed up in my phone app! They still didn’t believe me, though.

Who even cares anymore. I’ll forget about this by next month.

They came to the assumption that I must’ve gotten lost on my way to the cottage, which is why Shae was gone when I got there. I didn’t believe it - I recalled taking a direct path both to and from the cabin during that time, but I was severely lacking a better explanation that made sense. No use dwelling on it now, I guess.

I tossed the green onion into the hot pan, the sound of it sizzling within the oil at once filling the room.

"Smells good!" Liam shouted from his spot on the couch.

"Yeah, would you be able to help in a minute?" I asked.

"Sure! Just let me finish this paragraph..." he said, returning focus to the laptop screen. I had gotten a good start for myself on that assignment earlier, but wanted to be sure the food would be ready when everybody got here.

I grabbed the carrots out of the fridge. The kitchen was severely lacking a peeler or anything of the sort, so I resorted to chopping up the carrots as finely as possible. After checking the timer on my phone, I saw the rice had about ten minutes left before I could add it to the stir fry, which gave me just enough time to get all the other vegetables and tofu ready beforehand.

I couldn’t help but return to that one thought, despite trying to focus on the cooking. Someone else will see it for myself. It had been clogging my mind since I got back, no end in sight. What could it possibly mean? Like a broken record, I kept replaying the words from… not-Tyler? Even if that phone call didn’t happen, something fuckin’ did. I answered a phone call, completely conscious.

My mind continued racing as I focused on the glide of the knife through the carrots, the pieces becoming thinner as I diced.

"Hey!" Liam exclaimed from the other side of the counter, scaring the absolute shit out of me.

"FUCKING- oh my god," I shouted, jumping back. I take a few breaths before speaking again, "Why?" I questioned, my voice sounding tired.

"I said ‘hey’ three times from the couch before you noticed me! You weren’t listening." Liam replied with his hands on his hips, laughing. He’s pretty used to me zoning out at this point.

"I feel like there are better ways to handle that, though!"

"Yeah, that aren’t nearly as fun!" he said as he walked around the counter, putting one of his arms around my back. "So, what do you need help with?"

Hmm, I hadn’t really thought that far.

I pause for a moment, humming lightly as I think, "...Could you cut up the tofu for me?" I say, handing him one of the knives I had set out on the counter.

"Sure, but if I cut my finger off, I’m blaming you," Liam asserted.

"What? How could you even manage that, it’s like... a big block of Jell-O."

"You fail to understand my inability to do anything cooking related," he replied, smirking.

"That’s why you have me! After this trip you won’t have to make yourself ramen and microwave meals all the time in the dorm kitchen." I joked.

"God, I think my body is at least fifty-percent ramen at this point."

"Exactly!"

After we finished prepping the ingredients, I ignited one of the burners on the stove and set a pan atop it. I tossed the tofu Liam had prepared into the pan along with some sesame oil, adding the vegetables shortly thereafter. I glanced at the timer. The rice still had about five minutes before I could add it to the stir fry. Luckily, it seemed almost perfect timing that someone had knocked on the door. I washed my hands and approached it swiftly in excitement, swinging the door open.

"Alex! Just get off work?" I asked.

"Nah, got off a while ago. But I did stop by the liquor store on my way here!" Alex exclaimed, holding up a 24-case of beer.

"Nice, well get in here! I’m just making food for everybody," I said, leaving the door open as I headed back to the kitchen. Alex followed shortly thereafter.

"Ahem," Liam announced from across the counter.

"Fine, we’re making food," I confessed. Alex laughed in response as he set the beer on the counter.

"When’s everybody else getting here?"

"Uh, should be here soon, probably? I didn’t really give anyone a specific time to show up."

"Welp, sweet. Need help with anything, then?" Alex asked.

"Hmm, you could probably set up a fire in the fireplace? It’s going to be getting cold out pretty quick and this place doesn’t have heating so…" I replied, trailing off before I could finish the sentence.

"Got any more firewood? Fairly sure we used all that bag last night."

"I saw there was like a ton stacked along the outside of the cabin this morning. The side that’s opposite to the firepit," I said. 

"Wow, so that bag of firewood we bought last night was a waste, nice," he joked as he walked outside. 

"Pretty much, yeah," I muttered, thinking that I probably should’ve seen that when we first got here yesterday.

With Alex out to grab firewood, I went back to working on the food. It wasn’t much work at this point, I simply stirred the vegetables as they fried in the pan. A noticeable light-golden hue was beginning to form on tofu, and I could feel myself growing hungrier by the second. As the rice was almost done cooking, I finished up the vegetables and added the rice to the sizzling pan. I stirred the mixture for a few minutes before turning off the burner, letting the food cool down a bit before serving it.

"I don’t think you actually told me what we’re all doing tonight, what’s the plan?" Liam asked, leaning on the opposite side of the counter.

"Oh yeah, I guess I didn’t tell you," I said, a bit embarrassed at my forgetfulness. "Remember yesterday when Shae suggested that Elliot could bring movies over? I asked him about that, and he said he’d bring over a ‘great’ one, which can mean a lot of things, especially when it comes to Elliot."

"Wait, so you don’t know what movie he’s bringing? That sounds potentially awful," Liam countered, only slightly joking.

"Potentially! But that’s the point!" I exclaimed.

"What’s the point?"

"That it’s potentially awful!"

"Okay, I think I’m lost," Liam remarked, chuckling under his breath.

"Shitty movies can be just as entertaining as the movies people put actual effort into if you find the right one. Why do you think I took you to see Civilization Lost: Retrograde?" I replied.

"That movie?? I just assumed you forgot to check the reviews before you bought the tickets," Liam exclaimed, an incredulous grin on his face.

I replied, knowing I was only digging this hole deeper seemingly for no reason, "I never check the reviews."

"What?!? Then how would you know you're not going to be wasting thirty bucks on tickets and snacks?"

"Well, first of all, it’s never a waste to spend money on snacks," I replied as Alex came back inside with the firewood he promised to fetch. Although, it seemed that Liam didn’t notice his return in the midst of our pointless argument, despite his acute hearing. Alex seemed to notice this, and looked to be quietly approaching Liam from behind, wanting to take advantage of this interesting opportunity. "Second of all, even if the movie is shit, at the very least you get to laugh at how awful it is," I replied, not wanting to ruin it for Alex.

"Until you see a movie like ‘Civilization Lost: Retrograde’! Also known as the most boring movie ever unearthed by the world’s top archeologists," Liam retorted, lightly laughing at his own… joke?

"Okay, I will admit that movie was entirely the most miserable, awful movie I may have ever seen. But at the very least it had a couple ‘so-bad-it’s-good’ moments–" As I finish my thought, Alex seizes the moment, and lightly pulls him back in a moment that feels like a lifetime.

At once, I see Liam's eyes widen and pupils begin to dilate, almost before Alex even made the attempt to scare him. In one swift motion, Liam turns around, grabbing Alex partly by the shoulders and arms. Alex reacts with what can only be described as a yelp, and before I know it, he is tackled to the ground by the bobcat. There are a few seconds of silence after the first commotion, before they decide to speak up.

"Arghhhh, it hurts..." Alex groaned, face down on the floor.

"...Eh, you’re fine." I said, trying to stifle my laugh.

"What the fuck Alex! You scared the shit out of me, I could have hurt you or something!" Liam practically shouted. Good thing this cabin is remote, I guess. Would rather not have a cop or something checking in to make sure everything’s okay because of a noise complaint.

"Thought it’d be pretty funny… was kind of right, in a way." Alex said, still laying on the floor, laughing at his poor decisions. We all shared a bit of a laugh at whatever all of that was supposed to be, and Alex eventually got to work on getting the fireplace going, albeit a bit begrudgingly at this point. Fairly quickly after that, the rest of the group began to make their appearances, around the same time Shae came out of her room to help set up the table for everyone.

As Elliot, Shae, Tyler, and Liam take their seats, I finish plating the food as well as taking out the drinks that've been chilling in the fridge. It also looks like Alex got the fire going at a good strength, so I enlist him to take the drinks to the table as I start to bring the… I think they're called serving platters? Damn, I should've got a job as a line cook or something.

No. I don't think I'd be able to handle the average chef temper.

I started to set down the two platters I had in my hands on the free spaces on the dinner table, "Dig in everybody!" I exclaimed, taking my seat at the head of the table.

"I was one-hundred percent expecting you to just order a pizza or something, but this looks fantastic, Jake!" Alex exclaimed.

"Oh, thanks Alex! I'm used to making enough for just one or two, so I was worried I'd fuck up a bigger meal like this." I replied. "Also, thanks for doing the drinks..."

"Yeah, no problem. Plus, it looks good! Like it belongs in a restaurant."

We all sat and enjoyed ourselves through dinner, with Alex, Tyler, and Liam doing most of the conversing between one another. Elliot and Shae would occasionally chime in, but it felt like something was off. Not with my friends, but just... everything. I couldn't get my mind off of what happened earlier, it still rattled in the back of my brain, as do most anxieties nowadays. I hesitated to look out the windows of the cabin, though nothing was visible beyond them at this hour. At the very least, I could try to focus on spending some time with my friends.

"So, anyone else ready for some more drinks?" Elliot asked as we all cleared our plates.

"Yeah, sure," Shae replied, getting up to move the empties off the counter.

"Yeah, me too," Tyler agreed, also getting up.

"Aye, I’m down," Alex said. "You going to want one?" I asked, leaning over to Liam.

"Yeah, I'd probably have one more, but can't guarantee I won't pass out from exhaustion within the next two hours," Liam joked.

"Liam! Get your ass up! Don't you dare be falling asleep on me!" Alex yelled, getting up as well and playfully ruffling Liam's head.

"I'M STILL SO TIRED FROM YESTERDAY THOUGH…" Liam argued back in a purposefully whiny voice.

"Alright, calm down," I joked, taking a beer from Elliot as he passed a few around, it's incredibly chill to the touch, having sat in the fridge for a while now. "What do you guys want to do now? I can’t have fun without the internet," I asked, definitely not being subtle about how much of a city-boy I've become.

"Well, I for one will be back while you guys sort out this crushing dilemma," Alex remarked, reaching for the lighter in his pocket.

"I might tag along actually; you want to come with?" I said before putting my shoes on, looking over at Liam.

"I might for a second, but I’ll freeze pretty quick," he said, laughing at himself.

"Dude, you’re built for this weather! Is that even a factor for you?" Alex said as we began walking to the door.

"What, you’re just going to leave this decision to us? The most indecisive of the group?" Shae exclaimed.

She wasn’t wrong. Shae could spend hours comparing two items before buying one, and Elliot was very opinionated on most things. Generally, this was a terrible combination, and Tyler has always been ‘along-for-the-ride’ on any group decisions. I used to be the same, but years of dealing with it turned me quite impatient.

"Not at all, sire! We’ll discuss outside post-haste and get back to you with some notes, we expect you to do the same!" I exclaimed before heading outside.

"Still a bad idea," I heard getting increasingly muffled from Shaela as the door shut behind me. Liam and Alex had not quite followed me out yet.

It was dark out at this point. Occasional headlights could be seen along the tree line, but only the moonlight offered any vision. The air was getting crisp, and the snow left muted tones as it compacted under my boots. The moon danced between the clouds, fading in and out of sight.

Could go for that light right now. Where’s Alex?

I’ve barely smoked weed since high school, really. Liam was no stranger to it, but he was never the one to suggest it, so we’ve both been fairly secluded in that department.

I was still worked up from earlier. It did annoy me how they dismissed my words so easily, even if it did sound a bit out of the ordinary. The first call from Tyler was there. He doesn’t think it happened, but at the very least he called me??? Maybe it was just a butt dial, and I hallucinated the rest, but come on, the call literally happened!

Finally, a wave of ease washes over me as I hear a click from the door behind me. I stay still, leaning over the patio railing.

"Did you have to call a taxi to come out here?"

Alex scoffed, "You put your shoes on like some kind of speed demon! Some of us tie our shoes…"

"Tie them once and you’re set for life! What else do you need?" I joked.

"Shoes that don’t fall apart in six months?" Liam retorted curtly, laughing at me afterwards.

"More like a year, but close enough!" I resigned.

Alex grabbed a tightly rolled joint from his pocket and made several attempts to spark his lighter. He eventually succeeds and takes a drag.

"Would I have to buy Velcro shoes for you to start putting them on like a functional member of society?" Liam asked. Jokingly, I assume.

"You’re imagining a scenario that will never occur, so it’s not even worth it, really," I answered.

Alex passes the joint to me before speaking up, "Literally just start wearing loafers, maybe people will think you’re an adult for once."

"Loafers?! I don’t think I could be associated with you in that case Jake," Liam admitted before turning to Alex, "The dude’s entire outward appearance relies on being approachable and easy-going, loafers would ruin the whole shtick!"

I exhaled, ready to start complaining, "Good to know that having good attire is a prerequisite to getting your respect."

"I mean… loafers… In that specific case, yes," Liam confessed.

"Maybe I’ll give you that one," I said, taking one last drag and passing to Liam.

We still had to decide our plans. It seemed everyone wanted the night to continue, but this town is as lifeless as it was years ago. There’s not much in the way of nightlife, unless you make it yourself. Unfortunately for us, we’re lacking the social connections for that possibility.

Doomed to make our own fun, just as it was before I left.

Liam exhaled smoke before speaking up, "It’s not too dark yet… night walk?"

"I mean, I guess?" Alex questioned.

"God, you and your nighttime runs, I wish I could feel half as safe as you do on those dark Vancouver walking paths," I joked.

"You’re literally a man, Jake!" Alex said, laughing at me. Liam nodded his head towards Alex, keeping eye contact with me to make a point in the most annoyingly Liam way possible.

"Well, I think we are all well aware of my severe cowardice at this point."

Liam chuckled, "true enough," passing the joint to Alex.

"It’s not necessarily a bad idea though," Alex pointed out, "we still got under an hour of light left, and I had to skip the gym today to be here!"

"Since fucking when…" was about all I could say in my sigh of inferiority.

"...Do I have a gym membership? I think the goddamn contract actually renews in a couple months. I kind of regret it, only going ‘cause I didn’t want to waste the money." Alex explained.

"Subtle brag, but I can respect it," Liam nodded, hindering a laugh.

"Also was a dig at Jake. I’m assuming he used the university gym like… zero times so far?" Alex joked.

"I’ve actually gone with Liam twice now, so, wrong!" I said, beginning to lose my grip on this conversation as the effects settle in.

"Should we really be smoking up if y’all want to go for a walk in the woods?" Alex questioned, ignoring my comeback.

"I mean, Shae practically had to babysit us all the time in high school. Not much difference," I joked.

"True," Alex said before taking a drag and passing it back to me, "Honestly, that’s business as usual."

I took in my decidedly last inhale. The flavour of the smoke never got better, I just started to ignore it. My surroundings began to lose its harsh nature, being replaced with a sense of apathy.

As much as I despise the notion, Liam does love exercising at night-time for whatever reason. He says he doesn’t feel judged in the dark hours, probably due to less street goers. I personally feel more judged by potential terrifying creature monsters at night, so it’s hard to empathise.

"I'll see if they want to do that night walk thing, you guys can wait here," Liam said, walking back to the door.

"Sounds good," I said, my mind drifting.

As Alex finished off the joint, I stepped down the patio stairs, and walked over to the firepit we sat by last night. It was beyond extinguished now, only dry charcoal and ash left.

That was when I felt excited for the trip. Before we left for Vestige, I was nothing but anxiety and pessimism. Now, those feelings seem to be making their way back. I can’t even blame anyone for it, the group has been surprisingly upbeat so far. I know we’re only one day in, but this trip might actually not be a waste of time. I just have to try not to squander it.

Even with the spring melt in full force, there was little life to the world at night. The sound around me was desolate, with only the crunch of ice beneath me to fill the silence.

"You just going to brood mysteriously?" Alex said, making his way over.

"Aren’t we waiting for them to get their shit together in there?" I remarked.

"I mean, kind of," he replied.

Shae’s probably having trouble getting Liam out the door. That’s a typical night out for them in Vancouver, though.

"Sad you can’t hear from all your uni pals?" Alex questioned.

"I can hear from them fine. But no, I have not yet made the effort to reach out to them over the break, if that’s what you're asking," I replied. "It’s only been like two days, anyway. You wouldn't even do that for me!"

"I don't need to! We’ve known each other for how many years?" Alex joked.

"Don’t even make me try to calculate that, all I know is we were eight. Besides, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t check in on a friend!" I exclaimed.

"Checking in on a friend is a two-way street…" Alex said melodically. I just looked over at him in response. "Chill, dude! I know you were busy with your education and all that stuff. I’m just pointing out that maybe you could’ve also just messaged me once in a while."

"Well obviously, I was just pointing out that some people don’t need to check in on each other," I said. "We’re literally an example, dude! There’s an assumption, we’re chill."

He just thought for a moment. "I cannot believe the words you are saying to me right now," Alex replied.

"Bro..." I said, trailing off.

"What if I moved to Tucson, outta nowhere Jake! You’d have no idea."

"...You’re not goin’ to fuckin’ Tucson Alex," I said, mildly confused, "and if you were, then tough shit, cause I’m not going to goddamn Arizona."

Alex was always like this when we were teens, one to strike up an argument just for the fun of it – and it is fun to him, somehow.

"So, you’re saying you wouldn’t visit me if I moved to Tucson? That’s so rude!" Alex exclaimed.

"Who gives a shit about Tucson?!? You don’t know anyone there anyway."

"...I think you’re missing the point here," he said, despondent.

"I think the point is: fuck Arizona."

"You’re literally a fucking cali-boy Jake, you don’t have the right to talk shit on any other state," Shae butt in - walking up with Elliot and Liam.

I might be a bit overcritical of any U.S. state.

"Is it fair to call me a ‘California Boy,’ as you so kindly put it, when I stopped living there at the age of five?" I asked.

"Once a cali-boy, always a cali-boy," Elliot retorted.

"Is that so?" I asked, playing a little dumb.

Shae just stared at me. "It’s the vibe, Jake."

"Okay, there is no way I have an ‘L.A. vibe,’ whatever that fucking means," I replied. Shae and Elliot kind of just glanced at each other. "WHAT THE SHIT IS AN L.A. VIBE?" I asked, exasperated. These three, always fucking with me.

"I wouldn’t worry about it," Alex said.

Shae, Elliot, and Alex, the Trinity of Bullshit.

"Okay, you’re the reason this topic even came up Alex, just give me a straight answer!" I demanded.

"Picture your exact personality, and then... yeah that’s basically it," Shae joked.

"Okay, that’s how I know you’re bullshitting me."

"I would never bullshit you, Jake!" Shae exclaimed.

"Aren’t we trying to go do something? Can we get a move on guys?!?" I said before finally turning to head for the trail.

They’re lucky it’s beautiful out tonight. I’m usually a bit more stubborn.

We started following along one of the most prominent paths, taking in the hushed night.

"So, what the hell are we even doing out here anyway?" Liam asked.

"Questions, questions..." Alex said. "Can’t we just go for a walk? It’s beautiful outside!"

"It’s fine. About twenty degrees too cold for ‘beautiful’ though," Shae retorted.

"Anyone have an idea of where were headed?" Elliot asked.

"Nope! But the cabin owners said the trails are essentially big loops. If you just stick to a path long enough, it should get you back eventually," Jake replied.

Elliot made a look of mild surprise, "you’re telling me that none of these trails go anywhere?"

"Obviously they go out into the mountains somewhat, but the main paths for that are over on the south side of the lake, more touristy there," Alex answered. "Might even find a sealed-off mine or two if you look hard enough."

Mines weren’t hard to come by around here. Anyone from the area was aware of the 19th century California gold rush. It set the foundation a lot of these towns were built on.

"Why exactly would you want to find a sealed off mine, anyway? They sealed it up for a reason!" Liam exclaimed.

"I’ve only seen one mine by the main hiking trail, but I’ve heard the stories people around town like to tell, without a doubt. Kept me too scared to go checking them out, but maybe for the best," I remarked.

"Jake, if I have to hear Elliot go on about this shit one more time, I might actually fucking lose my mind," Alex retorts.

"Oh god, is this some conspiracy shit? Those TikTok's you send me aren’t funny Jake, those people need to see a therapist, or something," Liam complains.

I only sent those one or two times, anyway. But he’s probably right. It’s amazing what the internet is willing to show you these days - or what people are willing to post.

"It’s not a conspiracy! I wasn’t saying anything beyond the fact that there are mines, and there were several criminal cases related to them over the years, most from when it was still open!" Elliot argued, "Anything beyond that is pure conjecture."

"...What are you two arguing about again?" Shae asked.

I could tell this was an old topic between the two. Elliot was always the walking encyclopedia, but I felt it was an atypical topic for him to be so passionate about. Alex did always enjoy poking and prodding at his interests, though, so it wasn’t the most unusual thing for him to be reacting so defensively.

"Elliot’s trying to get us trapped in those mines, straight out of a serial killer mystery plot," Alex complained.

Was he still holding on to those folk tales we heard as kids? Obviously, I’m not denying those mines are fucking creepy to even look at. But the only danger is from the usual fear of structural collapse.

"I never suggested entering the mines, I was just interested in the lore!" Elliot explained.

"Always with you and the lore... have you ever tried uncovering the lore of our Lord and saviour?" Alex joked.

"The Bible? Wasn’t impressed, really. Kinda slow." Elliot commented.

"This conversation is getting a bit derailed; might I suggest the dilemma of this upcoming fork in the road?"

He was right, there was a divergence in the path up ahead. I don't *think* I saw that on the trailmap, but every trail that was marked led right back to the main road eventually, so...

"I guess we can just pick one and see where it leads," I suggested, looking at the two paths in front of us.

"Sounds like an adventure," Liam said with a grin.

"Left or right?" Shae asked, looking at the group.

"Let's go left," Alex decided, pointing to the aforementioned path.

We followed the path, our footsteps echoing in the quiet night. The moonlight filtered through the trees, casting shadows on the ground. The air was crisp and cold, but it felt refreshing. The sound of the wind rustling through the leaves was soothing.

After a while, the path met up with a small stream that flowed towards the lake. The water was clear and cold, and the moonlight reflected off the surface.
